      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "3.  **Echo Emission:** The Lumin can then \"emit\" these absorbed colors onto specific objects or areas. For example, emitting a \"red\" echo might cause a withered flower to bloom, revealing a hidden path, or playing a \"blue\" echo might trigger a water-based mechanism.\n",
       "4.  **Puzzle Solving:** Puzzles are environmental and narrative-driven. Players must deduce which echoes are needed and where to apply them to progress. Some puzzles might require combining multiple echoes, creating new colors or effects.\n",
       "5.  **Narrative Unfolding:** As more echoes are absorbed and emitted, the world gradually regains its color, and the Lumin pieces together the story of why it faded, often through poignant visual and auditory flashbacks.\n",

       "*   These pulses travel through the environment, interacting with objects and surfaces.\n",
       "*   **Echoes:** When a pulse hits an object, it generates an echo. The type of echo depends on the object's material and shape (e.g., a metallic surface creates a sharp, high-pitched echo; a soft, mossy surface creates a muffled, low-pitched echo).\n",
       "*   **Manipulation:** Players can \"grab\" and manipulate these echoes. They can:\n",
       "    *   **Reshape:** Alter the echo's frequency, amplitude, and duration.\n",
       "    *   **Redirect:** Change the echo's trajectory, bouncing it off other surfaces.\n",
       "    *   **Combine:** Merge multiple echoes to create new, more complex sound patterns.\n",
       "*   **Environmental Interaction:** Specific sound patterns trigger environmental changes. For example:\n",
       "    *   A high-frequency echo directed at a dormant seed might cause it to sprout.\n",
       "    *   A low-frequency echo resonating with a crumbling wall might cause it to collapse.\n",

       "3.  **Sound Emission:** The player emits a sound pulse.\n",
       "4.  **Echo Generation:** The environment generates echoes based on the pulse's interaction with objects.\n",
       "5.  **Echo Manipulation:** The player manipulates the echoes, reshaping, redirecting, and combining them to create the required sound pattern.\n",
       "6.  **Puzzle Solution:** The correct sound pattern triggers the desired environmental change, allowing the player to progress.\n",
       "7.  **Restoration:** Solving puzzles gradually restores life to the environment, revealing new areas and challenges.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nMovie Review (Over 500 Words) Film Title: Interstellar (2014) Director: Christopher Nolan\\nChristopher Nolan’s Interstellar stands as one of the most ambitious and emotionally resonant\\nscience-fiction films in contemporary cinema. Blending theoretical physics with intimate human drama,\\nthe film explores the tension between scientific progress and human vulnerability. At its core,\\nInterstellar is not merely a story about space exploration; it is a powerful reflection on love, sacrifice,\\nand the survival of humanity.\\nThe film follows Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, who is recruited for a last-chance mission\\nthrough a wormhole to find a habitable planet for humankind. Earth is slowly dying, and human\\ncivilization is on the brink of collapse. What makes the narrative compelling is the emotional dilemma\\nCooper faces: to save humanity, he must leave behind his young daughter, Murph, who perceives his\\ndeparture as abandonment. This father-daughter relationship becomes the emotional anchor of the\\nentire film and elevates it far beyond a traditional space-adventure storyline.\\nVisually, Interstellar is stunning. Nolan’s commitment to realism, paired with physicist Kip Thorne’s\\nscientific consultation, results in some of the most breathtaking depictions of cosmic phenomena ever\\ncaptured on film. The portrayal of the wormhole, the tidal-wave planet, and especially the now-iconic\\nvisualization of the black hole “Gargantua” are not only visually mesmerizing but also grounded in real\\nscientific theories. These visuals serve not as mere spectacle but as integral elements that enhance the\\nnarrative’s sense of urgency and wonder.\\nIn terms of performance, Matthew McConaughey delivers one of the strongest roles of his career. His\\nportrayal of Cooper is filled with emotional depth, internal conflict, and unwavering determination. Anne\\nHathaway, playing Dr. Amelia Brand, brings both intelligence and compassion to her role, contributing\\nto the film’s message that love—although intangible—may hold its own kind of logic within the universe.\\nJessica Chastain’s performance as the adult Murph is equally compelling; her anger, heartbreak, and\\neventual reconciliation with her father give the film’s final act its emotional catharsis.\\nOne of the film’s greatest strengths lies in Hans Zimmer’s unforgettable score. The music—dominated\\nby organ-based themes—creates a grand, almost spiritual atmosphere. Zimmer’s compositions amplify\\nthe emotional weight of key scenes, whether it’s the quiet loneliness of deep space or the\\noverwhelming sense of time slipping away. The soundtrack does not simply accompany the film; it\\nbecomes an essential part of its storytelling.\\nWhile Interstellar is widely praised, it is not without its critics. Some viewers argue that the film’s final\\nact becomes overly abstract or sentimental. The idea that love can transcend dimensions or influence\\nscientific decisions may feel philosophically heavy or even implausible. However, Nolan’s intention\\nseems clear: he aims to push the boundaries of both scientific imagination and human emotion,\\nblending them into a narrative that is as speculative as it is heartfelt.\\nUltimately, Interstellar remains a bold, visually spectacular, and emotionally powerful film. It challenges\\naudiences to reflect on the nature of time, the fragility of human existence, and the profound\\nconnections that define our lives. Its combination of scientific ambition and emotional storytelling\\nensures that it continues to resonate long after the credits roll. For viewers who appreciate films that\\nstimulate both the mind and the heart, Interstellar is an unforgettable cinematic experience.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
